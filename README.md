# robux-drainer
this tool grabs the robux from the inputed cookies

usage:
- change `robux_receiver_user` in main.py and input the cookies in `cookies.txt` and split them by creating a new line.
- `robux_receiver_user` will receive the robux via gamepasses so gamepasses have to be created to receive any robux

functions:
- auto refresh cookie: this means this will commpletly bypass roblox ip lock on cookies
- auto scrape gamepasses
- auto split robux to receive the most robux by deleting and more

please be aware: I already used this on a big cookie list somehow it decided not to work on my ip (germany) but after switching to USA it worked again.
